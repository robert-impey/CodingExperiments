        <li character="FALSTAFF">Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
</li>
        <li character="PRINCE_HENRY">Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
the time of the day.
</li>
        <li character="FALSTAFF">Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
thou wilt have none,--
</li>
        <li character="PRINCE_HENRY">What, none?
</li>
        <li character="FALSTAFF">No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
prologue to an egg and butter.
</li>
    </ul>
